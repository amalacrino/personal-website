abstract = "The parasitoid complex of the Asian chestnut gall wasp Drycosmus kuriphilus Yasumatsu was studied in Calabria (Italy). A total of 14 different species of parasitoids were collected, of which three are recorded on the Asian gall wasp for the first time. The composition of the parasitoid complex collected in Calabria was compared with that reported from Italy and from Europe. The altitude of the sites of collection seemed to have an effect on the distribution and abundance of the single species of parasitoids."
