abstract = "Plant-associated microbiomes assist their host in a variety of activities, spanning from nutrition to defence against herbivores and diseases. Previous research showed that plant-associated microbiomes shift their composition when plants are exposed to stressors, including herbivory. However, existing studies explored only single herbivore-plant combinations, whereas plants are often attacked by several different herbivores, but the effects of multiple herbivore types on the plant microbiome remain to be determined. Here, we first tested whether feeding by different herbivores (aphids, nematodes and slugs) produces a shift in the rhizosphere bacterial microbiota associated with potato plants. Then, we expanded this question asking whether the identity of the herbivore produces different effects on the rhizosphere microbial community. While we found shifts in microbial diversity and structure due to herbivory, we observed that the herbivore identity does not influence the diversity or community structure of bacteria thriving in the rhizosphere. However, a deeper analysis revealed that the herbivores differentially affected the structure of the network of microbial co-occurrences. Our results have the potential to increase our ability to predict how plant microbiomes assemble and aid our understanding of the role of plant microbiome in plant responses to biotic stress."
