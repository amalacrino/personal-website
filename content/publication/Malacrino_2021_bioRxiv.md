abstract = "Microorganisms have an enormous impact on most of the life that inhabits our planet. Insects are an excellent example, as research showed that several microbial species are essential for insect nutrition, reproduction, fitness, defence and many other functions. More recently, we assisted to an exponential growth of studies describing the taxonomical composition of bacterial communities across insects' phylogeny. However, there is still an outstanding question that needs to be answered: which factors contribute most in shaping insects' microbiomes? This study tries to find an answer to this question by taking advantage of publicly available sequencing data and reanalysing over 4,000 samples of insect-associated bacterial communities under a common framework. Results suggest that insect taxonomy has a wider impact on the structure and diversity of their associated microbial communities than the other factors considered (diet, sex, life stage, sample origin and treatment). Also, a survey of the literature highlights several methodological limitations that needs to be considered in future research endeavours. This study proofs the amount of collective effort that lead to the current understanding of insect-microbiota interactions and their influence on insect biology, ecology and evolution with potential impact on insect conservation and management practices."
