abstract = "The California red scale (CRS), Aonidiella aurantii (Maskell), is considered one of the most important pests of citrus in the Mediterranean basin as well as in other citrus growing areas worldwide. In Southern Italy, citrus is the most widely cultivated crop and the control of the CRS relies mainly on the application of synthetic insecticides. During 2009 and 2010, selected insecticides (spirotetramat, chlorpyriphos and pyriproxyfen) were evaluated against this pest in two calabrian citrus orchards (southern Italy) under integrated pest management. Treatments were performed according to the dosage reported on the label of the commercial products. Two treatments, at 15-day interval, were performed. Control plots were sprayed with water only. Efficacy was assessed 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after the first treatment and at the harvest. In both trials, spirotetramat showed the highest levels of efficacy against CRS and other citrus pests (citrus leafminer, and aphids) that were adequately controlled until the harvest. "
