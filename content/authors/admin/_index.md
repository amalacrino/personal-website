I’m a molecular ecologist interested in insect-microorganisms and plant-microorganism interaction. Currently I'm working on the molecular mechanisms behind plant-microorganisms interactions and their effects on surrounding biological communities. I’m also interested about the role of microbial symbionts in biological invasions, and about insect-microorganisms relationship in polyphagous species.
