Soon I'll join the [Plant-Adaptation-in-Action group](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Evolution/plantadapt/groupmain.shtml) at the University of Münster (Germany)!

**I’m a molecular ecologist interested in insect- and plant-associated microbiomes.**

I mix molecular biology, high-throughput sequencing and high-performance computing to answer important fundamental questions: how microbiomes influence the phenotype and fitness of their host? How microbiomes help invasive species to adapt to new environments? How microbes mediate the interaction between plants and their herbivores?
