Microorganisms are often considered as an extension (holobiont) of insects’ genome, [playing an important](https://amalacrino.netlify.app/publication/malacrino_2018_biology/) role in their hosts’ biology and natural histories (e.g., overcome plant defences, acquire immunity against their natural enemies, survive feeding nutrient-limited diets). My research showed that microbiomes help polyphagous species in feeding on a wide range of hosts [1](https://amalacrino.netlify.app/publication/malacrino_2018_pone/)[2](https://amalacrino.netlify.app/publication/strano_2018_meco/). Furthermore, I contributed to show that insects are part of complex ecological interactions with fungal plant pathogens [3](https://amalacrino.netlify.app/publication/malacrino_2017_funeco/)[4](https://amalacrino.netlify.app/publication/malacrino_2017_meco/)[5](https://amalacrino.netlify.app/publication/malacrino_2015_funeco/). These findings carried into a [new project](https://amalacrino.netlify.app/project/invasive/) where I explore the role of microorganisms in insect biological invasions.
