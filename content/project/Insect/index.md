Both insects and microorganisms stand out for number and diversity of species spread across different habitats. Microorganisms are often considered as an extension (holobiont) of insects’ genome, playing an important role in their hosts’ biology and natural histories (e.g., overcome plant defences, acquire immunity against their natural enemies, feeding nutrient-limited diets). Thus, if we understand how insect-associated microbiomes work and assemble, there is potential to manipulate insect-microorganisms relationship to alleviate the damages caused by insect pests. 

*My research investigates the factors that contributes to the structure of microbial communities associated with insects.*

One aspect of my research focuses on studying the variation in composition and diversity of insect-associated microbial communities in polyphagous species. Our results are of pivotal importance to explain the success of polyphagous insect pests in feeding on multiple hosts, and how we can manipulate those microbiomes to negatively influence insect fitness. This can also translate in wider fundamental questions: how do microbiome assemble? how microbiomes influence host's fitness?

My research also contributed to show that insects are part of complex ecological interactions with fungal plant pathogens, helping their spread. These results suggest that the impact of insect pests in agriculture and forestry might be more pervasive that we thought before. This has even more serious implications if we consider that non-native species, when invading a novel environment, can bring microorganisms from their native habitat. These microorganisms, mostly unidentified, can acquire competitive advantage in the novel environment and cause catastrophic economic damages.
