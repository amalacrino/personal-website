Microorganisms are often considered as an extension (holobiont) of insects’ genome, playing an important role in their hosts’ biology and natural histories (e.g., overcome plant defenses, acquire immunity against their natural enemies, survive feeding nutrient-limited diets). My research showed that microbiomes help polyphagous species in feeding on a wide range of hosts. Furthermore, I contributed to show that insects are part of complex ecological interactions with fungal plant pathogens. This threat is even more serious when we consider that invasive species can carry fungal plant pathogens from the native environment.
