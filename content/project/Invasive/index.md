Biological invasions are one of the results of the combined global warming and globalization. Species invading new territories can lead to catastrophic environmental and economic damages. I extensively worked with invasive species (small hive beetle, citrus insect scales, chestnut gall wasp, and many others), and part of my work focuses on how microbial communities can influence the spread of exotic species. With my collaborators we are showing that native and invasive species (or even genotypes) deal differently with microbiomes, which suggests that microbial communities can be one of the keys enabling successful insect invasions.
