A major threat to ecosystems worldwide is the spread of species outside their natural range, and this is indeed facilitated by our international trades. Species invading new territories can lead to catastrophic environmental and economic damages. I extensively worked with invasive species (citrus insect scales, chestnut gall wasp, small hive beetle,  and many others), and part of my work focuses on how microbial communities can influence the spread of exotic species. My research is showing that microbial communities can be one of the keys enabling successful insect invasions.
