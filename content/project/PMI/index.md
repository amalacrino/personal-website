Simplistically, we tend to explain primary productivity by the combined consumer-limited and resource-limited effects. While their specific importance is still being debated, the microbial dimension has been largely neglected. However, microorganisms play an extremely important role in plants, suggesting that they might be considered as an extension to the plant’s genome.  Although the plant microbiome is a core research topic, we still lack a comprehensive understanding of the factors regulating how microbial communities assemble, evolve and interact.

*My research investigates the factors that contributes to the structure of plant microbial assemblages, and how this influences insect herbivores*

We that plants are able to actively alter their microbiota on the basis of their needs, in particular for nutrient intake or during stress episodes, recruiting beneficial microbes that help to alleviate the negative effects produced by the stressor.

My research is showing that soil microbial community can  influence herbivore’s microbiome and fitness, through an effect medaited by plants (currently *under review*). This is of great applied  interest, because the manipulation of soil microbial communities can  give us access to herbivores’ microbiome, with potential applications in crop protection.
